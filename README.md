## :eyes: Special considerations when uploading code
* Always create a **_new branch_** to upload new and edited code
* Fetch origin before making any changes to your code
* Add a well written description to each commit
* Mention every single change done
* Create a pull request and merge the branch in the main after resolving any conflicts
* If you face any problems when merging a branch watch [this video](https://youtu.be/9j0AOrO0dnw?t=1086) or contact me :full_moon_with_face: 
* Use the seperate folder named "Proteus files" to upload any proteus project files 
* Use the seperate folder named "test2" to upload new or changed header files 

## Components that need to be completed
* - [x] Code for the Ultrasonic sensor (Detect the liquid levels once before the LCD Display starts)
* - [ ] Code for the calculation of pH values and required volumes
