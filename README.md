# Rubber Mixer v1.0
## Special considerations when uploading code
* Always create a **_new branch_** to upload new and edited code.
* Add a well written description to each commit.
* Create a pull request and merge the branch in the main after resolving any conflicts.
* If you face any problems when merging a branch watch [this video](https://youtu.be/9j0AOrO0dnw?t=1086) or contact me >_< .
* Use the seperate folder named "Proteus files" to upload any proteus project files .
* Use the seperate folder named "header files" to upload new or changed header files .
